# slitherlinky
A solver for Slitherlink (also called Loop-the-Loop) that uses SAT.


## About the game
Slitherlink, also called Loop the Loop in India, (and a plethora of other names
all over the world) is a logic puzzle. You can read more about it on
[Wikipedia]. Because it appears in the most popular English newspaper in India,
it is quite popular amongst Indians. 

Slitherlink is played on a rectangular lattice of dots. Some of the squares
formed by the dots have numbers inside them. The objective is to connect
horizontally and vertically adjacent dots so that the lines form a simple loop
with no loose ends. In addition, the number inside a square represents how many
of its four sides are segments in the loop.

*Slitherlinky* is a solver for slitherlink puzzles. Slitherlinky reduces a
puzzle to a SAT problem, which is solved by a SAT solver.
